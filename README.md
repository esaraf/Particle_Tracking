# Particle_Tracking
Source utilizing Ocean.parcels (pacakge) to simulate the movement of particles through specified current velocities.
This code is used for particle simulations influenced by current velocities

You can easily change the code to download data from a different server or change
the subsetted data location

The parcels file will allow you to dictate the timeline of particle movement 
you can add mortality or randomization biological factors to have a more credible
simulation.
